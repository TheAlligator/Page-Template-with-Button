            <p>
                <span class="firstcharacter">F</span><strong>rom her seat in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, Angela Payne’s eyes focused on her son.  </strong>
She watched him grab the season’s opening kickoff and return it 21 yards. She watched him get stopped by a defender and slammed onto another player and the ground. She watched him jog off the field.

            </p>
            <p>
But then she couldn’t watch him anymore. Dre Massey didn’t come back.
            </p>
            <p>
About a dozen of his closest family and friends were there to watch the wideout play in his first game for the Gators, and they were all asking the same question: Where’s Dre?

            </p>
          
            <p>
His mom doesn’t remember how long she waited, but sometime during the game, a text message from a UF coach gave her an answer.
            </p>
          
            <p>
“We’ve got Dre here in the back,” it read.
            </p>
            <p>
There’s no greater fear for the single mother of one than her only child getting hurt, so she turned to her faith for strength.
 
            </p>
            <p>
The 42-year-old believes God has a plan for Dre. She believes God will deliver him through any difficulty. She constantly sees signs of His presence. But until the game ended, all she could do was wait and pray.

            </p>
            <p>
After the game, she scurried down to the south end of the stadium near the Bull Gator statue. She rumbled down the stairs and entered a room where Dre was lying on a table in shorts and a T-Shirt. He was silent.

            </p>
            <p>
After sitting with him for several minutes while a trainer rubbed his knee, another trainer came in with the diagnosis.

            </p>

           

            <p>
Dre had torn his right ACL. The four-star junior college transfer — the one coach Jim McElwain had raved about; the one who was supposed to be a playmaker; the one who was supposed to help fix Florida’s long-broken offense — was going to miss his first season at UF after one play.

            </p>
            <p>
Was this what it had all been for? Was this why he’d clawed for the grades to qualify for Florida? Was this the result of all the storms — the moving, disappointment and death — he’d endured? Was this why he prayed?
            </p>
            <p>
To him and his mom, there was no doubt what this was. It was another sign. Another test. Another hurdle. Another part of a plan they couldn’t control.
            </p>
          <p>
          That’s why, after hearing the diagnosis, Dre turned to his mom and smiled.

          </p>
          <p>
          “OK,” he told her. “Here we go again.”

          </p>

        <p>
            <strong><span class="firstcharacter">O</span></strong>n a recent Saturday, Dre’s mom sat in a South Carolina McDonald’s sipping water through a straw. She was talking about the hardships her son had suffered. She was talking about his faith. Their faith. How they see signs of God everywhere. Suddenly, she gestured toward the restaurant’s indoor playground.


        </p>
        <p>
“Look at that,” she said as several kids yelped their way down a plastic slide.
        </p>
        <p>
“No,” she said, pointing at the playground again. “Look.”
        </p>
        <p>
There, above the shoe storage area, was a large black sign with bold white letters: Obstacle.
        </p>
        <p>
“Wow,” she said with a laugh.
        </p>
        <p>
“We can go somewhere and hear a word, and it’s confirmation from God.
        </p>
        <p>
“(That’s why) when obstacles come his way... he doesn’t even let it bother him. He’s just like, ‘God got me.’”
        </p>

        <p>
As a kid, Dre never had to be hounded about chores. He took out the trash and washed the dishes. He kept his clothes on their hangers and his shoes orderly. But the one thing his mom constantly had to harass him about waking up at 9 a.m. every Sunday for church.
        </p>
        <p>
“He felt like it’s Sunday. It’s time to rest,” Angela said. “Oooh no. You’re getting up to go to church.”
        </p>
        <p>
She was raised a Baptist by her mother, who made sure she went to church as a child. So when Dre was born, she did the same thing by taking him to the non-denominational Redemption World Outreach Center in Greenville, South Carolina, every Sunday morning at 10. By doing so, she instilled in Dre her devotion to Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
“He loves God,” Angela said. “And when I tell you he really trusts Him, he really trusts Him.”
        </p>

            </figure>
        <p>
Aside from religion, Dre grew up playing football. Or basketball. Or soccer. Anything, really, as long as he was outside.
        </p>
        <p>
Living in an apartment in Gray Court, South Carolina — a neighborhood of fewer than 1,000 people near Greenville — his family wanted him to stay active. His mom said the area — the same one where she met his father in high school — had drug problems, with dealers sometimes openly doing business on street corners. To help Dre avoid that, she kept him on the field.
        </p>
        <p>
Dre was always the star player, starting with flag football at 5 years old and youth tackle leagues later on. When he had the ball, he could score every time.
        </p>
        <p>
In class, he had trouble focusing. He couldn’t comprehend lessons as quickly as his peers. In elementary school, he was diagnosed with ADHD.
        </p>
        <p>
At the same time, some of his relatives died, and others ended up in prison for reasons he and his mom didn’t want to get into. His focus, however, never wavered from football. God was still guarding him.
        </p>
        <p>
“He doesn’t let it affect him,” his mom said. “Just keeps moving.”
        </p>
        <p>
Because of Dre’s football talent, other members of his family told his mom she should move him somewhere — anywhere — to give him more of a spotlight. A chance to succeed. A chance to get away from trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
She eventually found Mauldin, a suburb of Greenville, and settled in there. The local high school was fairly well known for sports — retired NBA star Kevin Garnett is an alumnus — and Dre figured it would be a chance for him to stand out.
        </p>
        <p>
  “So we went over there,” Dre said, “and I started sports... hoping I would make a name for myself.”
        </p>
        <p>
 But with his freshman year at Mauldin High School weeks away, that mission was jeopardized when his father died in a car accident.
        </p>
          
        <p>
He didn’t want to talk about it — and still doesn’t. His coaches at Mauldin could see it affected him — especially in the classroom — but his mom said he never brought it up. When asked recently how he moved past it, he gave a familiar answer.
        </p>
          
         
          
        <p>
“I guess like every other kid do,” he said. “Just keep moving.”
        </p>

            <strong><span class="firstcharacter">D</span></strong>re couldn’t focus after his dad’s death. As a freshman at Mauldin, his grades tanked. His ADHD didn’t get better. And as for football, he was placed on Mauldin’s third-tier freshman team.


        </p>
        <p>
Several months later, the varsity team’s starting quarterback broke his collarbone during spring practice. Coaches needed a replacement, so they gave Dre a shot.
        </p>
        <p>
“It was over after that,” then-offensive coordinator Lee Taylor said. “He started every game from there on.”
        </p>
        <p>
At the time, Dre wasn’t a polished passer. But he could run, and he could make plays.
        </p>
        <p>
Taylor had to raise his voice at him once after a four-interception performance against Greenville his sophomore year, but he said after that, he never had to again.
        </p>
        <p>
“We kinda just threw him to the wolves,” he said, “and I’ll tell you what: He shined from then on.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
He also never missed a play, as far as Taylor can remember, in his time as a starter.
        </p>
        <p>
“He took a lot of hits throughout his three years,” he said. “Especially his 10th-grade year. But he always got up.”
        </p>
        </p>
<p>Dre was pretty much the ideal video game quarterback. He had the vision to find holes in the defense and the speed to jet through them untouched. He could make tacklers miss or just run around them. And nobody — not even now, if you ask him — could catch him.

        </p>
        <p>
“He’s the best athlete and best football player I’ve ever coached, and I’ve been coaching for 28 years,” Taylor said. “If you watch him, he doesn’t look like he’s putting forth any effort, and he’s pulling away from people.”
        </p>
        <p>
His mom remembers newspaper stories being written about him weekly. She also remembers a kid asking him for his autograph one time after a game. Taylor said youth players in the area wanted to wear jersey No. 1 at the time just because Dre was No. 1.
        </p>
        <p>
“(But) Dre doesn’t feed off of that,” he added. “He’s just Dre.”
        </p>
        <p>
Anyone you ask — from coaches to his mom to teammates — will tell you Dre doesn’t like the spotlight. He’s never performed a touchdown dance. He’s never spiked a ball in celebration. When he scored his 11th touchdown in an 83-70 victory his senior year, he jogged to the bench and sat down.
        </p>
        <p>
“I have a headache,” he told a reporter when asked about the game.
        </p>
        <p>
Doug Shaw, who was the head coach at Mauldin from Dre’s freshman through junior years, also taught him in health class. He said that while Dre tried academically, he just didn’t get it a lot of the time. He was also — much like he was on the field — quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
“Sometimes,” Shaw said, “I’d have to look over and make sure he was still there.”
        </p>
        <p>
Shaw added that he’d sometimes call Dre to remind him about tests or projects or homework. “Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir,” he’d always say. And he’d try to get the concepts.
        </p>
       
        <p>
“I never had a teacher say, ‘Coach, he’s just sitting there,’” Shaw said.
        </p>
        <p>
When it was time to go to college, Dre was set to go to East Carolina. The Pirates were the only team that’d stuck with him knowing he had academic problems, Taylor said, and Dre appreciated that. But he didn’t get the necessary SAT scores.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
Taylor was on vacation when he got a call letting him know Dre didn’t make it. The call came from Jeff Koonz, the football coach at Holmes Community College in Goodman, Mississippi. Koonz knew about Dre’s academic struggles and had offered him a backup plan: If he didn’t qualify for ECU, he could go to Holmes for two seasons and, if his grades improved, transfer somewhere else.
        </p>
        <p>
With ECU not happening, that’s what he had to do.

In Goodman, Mississippi, there are no street lights. Just one four-way stop. There’s no interstate. That’s 30 minutes away. There aren’t any McDonald’s. Just a local burger place called Rick’s.
        </p>
        <p>
“It’s like a third-world country,” Koonz said.
        </p>
        <p>
But it was what Dre chose.
        </p>
          <p>“He did not like it here,” Koonz said. “He did not wanna be here. But most guys bitch and complain. He wasn’t a bitch-and-complainer. He did something about it.”
</p>
          <p>What he did was earn All-State and First Team All-Region honors in his sophomore season by hauling in 548 yards on 21 catches with six touchdowns. He was also the team’s Swiss Army knife, playing receiver, quarterback, running back and even punter.
</p>
          <p>
          As a result of his success, he earned scholarship offers from schools like Oklahoma, Auburn and hometown South Carolina. But when UF assistant coach Randy Shannon offered at Florida, there was no doubt about where he was going.

          </p>
          
          <p>A few weeks after he committed to UF, he was back in South Carolina when he went to the post office with his mom. He needed to pick up his acceptance letter.
</p>
          <p>His mom didn’t know that, though, and when he showed her the letter, she had to pull over in the parking lot to weep.
</p>
          <p>Dre captured the moment on Snapchat, captioning it, “Tears of joy man.” It was the realization of a talk Dre once had with Taylor.
</p>
          <p> “You know coach,” Dre told him, “I was supposed to be the one in my family to make it.”
</p>
          <p>“Well you know what?” Taylor answered. “Make it then.”
</p>

      <div class="text">
          <p>
Dre didn’t have to shake his man. He just sprinted past him and darted down the field.
        </p>
        <p>
Luke Del Rio saw him from 19 yards away and fired. Touchdown.
        </p>
        </p>
<p>
Dre grazed through the end zone and listened to the Swamp hum. He pointed to the sky and looked up. He was swarmed by his teammates. It was only the 2016 Spring game, but when McElwain brought Dre to Florida, he had these moments in mind.  That’s why, five months later, Taylor was confused.

        </p>
        <p>
When the regular season started, he watched Florida’s first game with his wife. He noticed Dre wasn’t playing, but he didn’t know about the injury. So he texted him the next morning. The 20-plus-year coaching veteran just wanted to check in on the player he called the best he’s ever coached.
        </p>
        <p>
Dre told him the news: torn ACL.
        </p>
        <p>
“I’ve been through so much in my life,” Dre added. “This is just something else I’m gonna have to overcome.”
        </p>
        <p>
To do so, he turned to three things: Faith, family and recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
Koonz described Dre as not being outward with his religion. He’s no Tim Tebow. But he is someone who brings up God in conversation. So to him, this was just another trying step on an unknowable path. When it happened, he told his mom not to worry. God had his back.
        </p>
        <p>
“That’s probably why when a lot of things happen to me,” he said, “I don’t really get down. Because my faith’s so strong.”
        </p>
        <p>
Dre’s mom calls him every day, timing their conversations around football practice. When he goes home to visit, she cooks him his favorite meal (chili dogs) and watches movies with him (horror flicks are his favorite, although she refuses to watch them). She rides along to McDonald’s, where Dre gets his usual McDouble and vanilla shake. She went to games even though he was limited to the sideline and by crutches. She still reminds him to go to church.
        </p>
        <p>
“She’s my everything,” he said.
        </p>
    <p>
    To recover, Dre often woke up before sunrise for physical therapy. He wanted to be ready for the season. And while he’s still in a brace, he said he’s pretty much back to full speed after seven months of training.

    </p>
    <p>
    Doctors told him he shouldn’t overdo it during his recovery. To take it slow. To do less. But Dre didn’t listen.
